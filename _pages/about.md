I am Dr. Sailendu Biswal, a Mechanical Engineer with a PhD in Solid Mechanics and over 8.5 years of experience spanning research, product development, and application engineering. Currently, I work as an Advanced Application Engineer at 3M India, where I focus on Modelling & Simulation of Product solutions, e-Powertrain and Exhaust systems. My role involves  new product development, application validation, and collaboration with global teams to deliver innovative solutions NVH and thermal management.

My research journey began with fracture mechanics and structural mechanics, where I pioneered studies on quasi-brittle materials under compressive loading and published in leading journals such as Engineering Fracture Mechanics and International Journal of Solids and Structures.

Beyond engineering, I am passionate about exploring new technologies, solving multidisciplinary challenges, and bridging the gap between research and industrial applications.
I thrive on solving complex engineering challenges and enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams to drive innovation. If you're interested in discussing research collaborations, structural analysis challenges, or new opportunities, feel free to connect!
