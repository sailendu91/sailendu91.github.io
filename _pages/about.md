I am a Mechanical Engineer with extensive experience in finite element analysis (FEA), structural mechanics, and product development. My expertise spans fracture mechanics, fatigue crack propagation, and experimental & numerical analysis of mechanical components in diverse industries, including automotive, wind energy, and adhesives & films.
Currently, I work as an Advanced Application Engineer at 3M India, focusing on product solutions for ePowertrain, and bonding & sealing technologies for automotive applications. My role involves technical collaboration with customers, application development, and working closely with global teams to drive innovative solutions for automotive subsystems such as Exterior, Interior, Body-in-White, ePowertrain, and Exhaust systems.
Previously, as a FEA Engineer at Garrett Advancing Motion, I specialized in structural analysis of turbochargers, optimizing their performance and durability under extreme conditions. My prior roles included working as a senior engineer at TATA Consulting Engineers Ltd., focusing on product design and special-purpose machine development. I also worked as an Assistant Manager at Enercon Wind Energy, where I contributed to load estimation and lifetime optimization for wind farms.
Academically, I hold a PhD in Solid Mechanics from IIT Delhi, where my research pioneered the study of fracture mechanics in quasi-brittle materials under compressive loading using advanced experimental and numerical techniques.
I thrive on solving complex engineering challenges and enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams to drive innovation. If you're interested in discussing research collaborations, structural analysis challenges, or new opportunities, feel free to connect!
