excerpt: 'The fracture behavior of quasi-brittle naturally occurring composites is characterized by the presence of fracture process zone (FPZ), which is attributed by crack bridging and micro-cracking in wood. The FPZ limits the use of existing standards for fracture toughness. Also, the repeated loading–unloading approach using single specimen is difficult due to crack face interference. Further, the crack growth monitoring is difficult since the crack tip may be buried inside FPZ. So far, the compliance based beam method (CBBM) has offered a reasonable solution to these challenges. However, the CBBM is not an absolutely independent approach as it uses elastic constant and compliance determined from other experiments. Naturally occurring materials, like wood, exhibits large variations in its properties. Therefore, the use of parameters from multiple other experiments decreases the confidence in measured fracture toughness. Considering this, the present work evaluates the fracture toughness attributed by critical energy release rate of New Zealand Pine wood. Firstly, the research method follows a stand-alone multi-specimen approach to evaluate fracture toughness without any requirement for crack growth monitoring. Secondly, it experimentally establishes the traction–separation relation for both Mode I and II. This work has a general applicability to other natural quasi-brittle orthotropic solids like bone.'
